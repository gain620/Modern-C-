```c++
#include <iostream>

struct E
{
  E() { std::cout << "1"; }
  E(const E&) { std::cout << "2"; }
  ~E() { std::cout << "3"; }
};

E f()
{ 
  return E();
}

int main()
{
  f();
}

```

### Answer

This question The program is unspecified / implementation defined.

### Explanation

In f(), an E object is constructed, and 1 is printed. This object is then returned to main(), and one could expect the copy constructor to be called, printing 2.

However, §6.6.3¶2 in the standard says "Note: A copy or move operation associated with a return statement may be elided", meaning that the implementation is free to skip the copy constructor. This is optional, and unspecified behaviour.

Most implementations will elide the copy constructor and output 13, but may be urged not to so with the -fno-elide-constructors option and output 1233.
